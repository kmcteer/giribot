# liribot

The liribot simulator is similar to the functioning of Siri (from Iphone).. 
Liri is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface versus siri is a Speech Interpretation
Liri will be able to search Sporify for songs, Bands in Town for COncerts and OMDB for movies

Throughout this LIRI bot, I used several technologies such as Node.js, J.S., Spotify, OMDB, and bands in town API's.
Liri partners with Node to submit the users request in the command line thats directly paired with information relating to; movie information, concerts, and music. Then liri will return information within those given measures and finish the request

Run the following commands;

node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
node liri.js do-what-it-says
